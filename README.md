# Mali News Aggregation

## description

Mali News Aggregation uses python, BeautifulSoup, and openpyxl to collect keyword data from Malian news sites and gather information on Russian involvement in Malian News.
At the moment, only the international news sections Maliweb and Malijet have been scraped.
Due to the layout of other Malian news sites, it has been challenging to collect the data.

## How to use
- Download the zip file of the project. If you are using Linux, you may need to set up a virtual environment in the project folder to use the requests, BeautifulSoup, and openpyxl modules.
- Run either maliweb.py or malijet.py. The links to scrape and the names of the xlsx files the data will be saved to are already provided,
- wait for the script to finish processing the data. Depending on your internet speed this may take some time.
- Once finished a xlsx file will be created in the root folder of the project
